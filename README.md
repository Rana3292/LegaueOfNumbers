KNOWN ISSUES:

At the Moment the Game League of Numbers is only Startable if you start it from scratch (Add all the Files and the Folder Structure in Eclipse and run the Board.java).
The Font Change is giving us a hard Time at the Moment but we are on to Fix that ASAP.

If you want to give us New ideas or a general Feedback feel free to write as well ;-)

ALSO HAVE A NICE DAY!
